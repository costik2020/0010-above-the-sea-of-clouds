				<p>I was siting and I was trying to imagine what was the hero from <span>Wanderer above the Sea of Fog</span> was seeing when he was on top of that mountain. And that is what I tried to comunicate through the use of CSS for the "hero" section of the web page. To transport the user in the shoes of that "Wanderer" who was watching from the highest mountain he was able to climb.  </p>
				<p>Wanderer above the Sea of Fog is a painting by German Romantic artist Caspar David Friedrich made in 1818. It depicts a man standing upon a rocky precipice with his back to the viewer; he is gazing out on a landscape covered in a thick sea of fog through which other ridges, trees, and mountains pierce, which stretches out into the distance indefinitely.
